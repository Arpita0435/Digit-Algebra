Virtual-Calculator

Introduction:

Here is source code for an example of hand tracking application (Virtual calculator) using openCV and mediapipe. It is a project for practicing skills in using openCV and image processing in computer vision. With this code, you can create a Virtual calculator and do basic mathematical calculation.

How to use:

I track index finger tip and middle finger tip if the distance between these tracking points is less than 35px then it is considered as a click. For more details about hand tracking, you can refer to the following links: https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/hands.html

Run the following command
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run project
python app.py
